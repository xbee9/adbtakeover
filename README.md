# adbtakeover
This is a bash script that helps you to takeover an android device present in the network.
This project is currently supported for Android TV's present in the network.
Though you can use this on any adb enabled device the default port it is using is '5555'.
If you want to use this script for any adb enabled device just change the port no. in the script.
This script is intentionally made slow so that fed's dont track you.
Thankyou for reading.
